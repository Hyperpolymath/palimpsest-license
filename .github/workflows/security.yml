# Security - CodeQL Analysis & Dependency Scanning
# =============================================================================
# Comprehensive security scanning for the Palimpsest License project.
#
# Jobs:
#   - codeql: Static analysis for vulnerabilities (JavaScript, Ruby, Actions)
#   - dependencies: Check for vulnerable dependencies
#
# Schedule: Runs weekly (Saturday 18:00 UTC) and on every push to main
#
# Note: Python and Rust scanning disabled - code removed from project.
#       Re-enable if those languages are added back.
