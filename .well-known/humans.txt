/* STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL */

  The Palimpsest License is governed by a 7-member Stewardship Council:

  3 × Creator Representatives (elected by community)
  2 × Legal Experts (IP, Dutch, or Scottish law)
  1 × Technologist (AI ethics/decentralised systems)
  1 × Cultural Heritage Advocate

  Terms: 2 years, staggered for continuity

  Current Council: [To be established in formal v1.0 launch]

/* SPECIAL THANKS */

  - The creator communities who shared their concerns and needs
  - Legal experts who provided guidance on international copyright
  - Technologists working on ethical AI and attribution systems
  - Cultural heritage advocates protecting vulnerable narratives

/* FOUNDING PRINCIPLES */

  This project was created in response to real concerns from:

  - Musicians whose protest songs were used without consent

  - Artists whose cultural heritage was appropriated
  - Storytellers whose emotional work was commodified
  - Communities whose collective knowledge was exploited

  We built this license for them, with them.

# =============================================================================
# PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================

/* WHY THIS EXISTS */

  "This is a license born not just from copyright, but from care.
   From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."

  We created the Palimpsest License because:

  - Creators are being exploited by AI systems trained without consent
  - Metadata is routinely stripped, erasing attribution and context
  - Emotional lineage (why something was created) is lost
  - Cultural heritage is appropriated without community involvement
  - Trauma narratives are commodified without care
  - Protest songs lose their activist context
  - Symbolic work is flattened into data points

  This license is an attempt to fight back with care, clarity, and
  future-proof technical mechanisms.

/* WHAT WE BELIEVE */

  ✓ Creators deserve protection and compensation
  ✓ Remix culture can coexist with creator rights
  ✓ Attribution is a technical problem with technical solutions
  ✓ Emotional context matters as much as legal credit
  ✓ AI can be ethical when built with care
  ✓ Community ownership is valid and valuable
  ✓ Transparency builds trust
  ✓ Care is as important as copyright
  ✓ The future belongs to those we protect now

/* WHAT WE OPPOSE */

  ✗ Exploitation of vulnerable creators
  ✗ Metadata stripping and attribution laundering
  ✗ AI training without consent or compensation
  ✗ Cultural appropriation disguised as "fair use"
  ✗ Corporate enclosure of creative commons
  ✗ Legal complexity that excludes non-lawyers
  ✗ Technology that prioritises profit over people
  ✗ Systems that erase emotional and cultural context

/* OUR HOPE */

  We hope the Palimpsest License becomes obsolete.

  We hope it becomes obsolete because:
  - AI systems implement consent by default
  - Attribution is automatic and unforgeable
  - Creators are fairly compensated
  - Cultural context is always preserved
  - Communities control their heritage
  - The law catches up to technology
  - Care becomes embedded in how we build

  Until then, we'll keep working.

# COLOPHON
# =============================================================================

/* NAMING */

  "Palimpsest" refers to a manuscript where earlier writing has been
  scraped away to make room for new text, but traces of the original
  remain visible. This license protects those traces—the emotional
  lineage, the cultural context, the narrative debt—ensuring they
  aren't erased as work is transformed and remixed.

  Every creative work is a palimpsest, layered with influences,
  contexts, and meanings. This license honours those layers.

/* VERSION HISTORY */

  v0.1: Initial concept
  v0.2: Community feedback integration
  v0.3: First stable draft with Dutch translation
  v0.4: Current version (active development)
  v1.0: Planned formal release

  Full history: /CHANGELOG.md

/* DOCUMENTATION */

  All documentation is written in Markdown for accessibility and
  version control. We prioritise clarity over legal jargon while
  maintaining necessary precision.

  Guide authors aim for:
  - Clear, active voice
  - Concrete examples
  - Cultural sensitivity
  - Accessibility (plain language options)
  - Bilingual parity (Dutch ↔ English)

/* METADATA STANDARDS */

  We use:
  - YAML frontmatter in Markdown files
  - JSON-LD for structured data
  - Schema.org vocabularies where applicable
  - Custom fields for Palimpsest-specific concepts

/* ACCESSIBILITY COMMITMENT */

  We strive for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all documentation:
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Sufficient colour contrast
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Clear, plain language options
  - Multiple format availability

/* SUSTAINABILITY */

  This project is designed to be sustainable through:
  - Open governance (no single point of failure)
  - Clear documentation (knowledge transfer)
  - Community ownership (not dependent on funding)
  - Modular structure (components can evolve independently)
  - Standard technologies (no exotic dependencies)

# FINAL THOUGHT
# =============================================================================

  If you've read this far, thank you.

  Behind every license clause is a person who was hurt.
  Behind every protection is a story that was stolen.
  Behind every requirement is a creator who deserves better.

  We built this with care. We hope you use it with care.

  We are humans, building for humans, protecting human creativity.

  Let's build a future where technology and humanity coexist with dignity.

                                    ♥
