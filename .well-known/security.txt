# About the Palimpsest License Project
# The Palimpsest License is a future-proof, layered licensing framework
# designed for creative work in the age of AI. We protect creators who work
# with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression.

# Scope
# This security policy covers:
# - License text and documentation repositories
# - Compliance and audit tooling
# - Metadata validation systems
# - Web infrastructure and presentation layers
# - Integration examples and code snippets

# What to Report
# We are particularly interested in vulnerabilities related to:
# - Metadata stripping or tampering (Clause 2.3 violations)
# - Attribution chain manipulation
# - Cryptographic signature weaknesses
# - Documentation injection attacks
# - Supply chain vulnerabilities in our tooling

# Response Time
# - Initial acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
# - Status update: Within 7 days
# - Resolution timeline: Based on severity assessment

# Out of Scope
# - Theoretical legal interpretations (use GitHub Discussions)
# - General feature requests (use GitHub Issues)
# - Third-party services not directly controlled by this project

# Responsible Disclosure
# We follow a coordinated disclosure process:
# 1. Report received and acknowledged
# 2. Vulnerability verified and assessed
# 3. Fix developed and tested
# 4. Security advisory published (if applicable)
# 5. Credit given to reporter (if desired)

# Special Considerations for This Project
# The Palimpsest License exists to protect creators from AI exploitation
# and metadata manipulation. Security vulnerabilities that could enable
# circumvention of these protections are treated with highest priority.

# Legal Safe Harbor
# We support security research conducted in good faith and will not pursue
# legal action against researchers who:
# - Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
# - Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond necessary verification
# - Follow our responsible disclosure process
# - Do not demand payment or compensation for disclosure

# Contact Methods Priority
# 1. Encrypted email to security@palimpsest-license.org (preferred)
# 2. GitHub Security Advisory (for code/infrastructure issues)
# 3. Regular email if encryption not available
