# Security Scope
# This security.txt covers:
# - Palimpsest License text vulnerabilities (legal interpretation ambiguities)
# - Metadata infrastructure (JSON-LD, Protocol Buffers, ndjson, Ecto schemas)
# - Validation tools (Haskell validators, ReScript components)
# - Documentation security issues (misleading guidance)
# - Website/infrastructure vulnerabilities
# - Cryptographic implementation flaws (quantum-proof traceability)

# Out of Scope
# - Third-party tools that use the license
# - User-generated content in examples
# - Theoretical attacks without proof of concept

# Coordinated Disclosure Timeline
# Day 0: Initial report received
# Day 1-2: Acknowledgment sent
# Day 3-7: Triage and severity assessment
# Day 7-90: Fix development and testing
# Day 90: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

# Safe Harbor
# Palimpsest License project commits to:
# - No legal action against good-faith security researchers
# - Recognition in security acknowledgments
# - Collaboration on responsible disclosure

# Special Considerations
# License Integrity: Vulnerabilities affecting license interpretation are CRITICAL
# Cultural Protection: Issues enabling cultural appropriation are HIGH priority
# AI Training: Vulnerabilities in AI consent mechanisms are HIGH priority
# Metadata Tampering: Attribution chain manipulation is CRITICAL
# Emotional Lineage: Attacks on symbolic attribution are HIGH priority

# Contact Methods
# Primary: security@palimpsest-license.org (PGP encrypted preferred)
# GitHub: Private security advisory (for repository issues)
# Emergency: Include [URGENT] in subject line for active exploitation

# Expected Response Times
# Critical: 24 hours
# High: 48 hours
# Medium: 7 days
# Low: 14 days

# Hiring
# We welcome security researchers to contribute to the Palimpsest License project.
# See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to get involved.
