# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
# Palimpsest License Project
# Version 1.0 | Effective: 2025-11-22

## Introduction

The Palimpsest License Project is committed to ensuring the security and integrity of our licensing framework, tooling, and infrastructure. This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy outlines our approach to receiving, assessing, and addressing security vulnerabilities reported by the security research community and the public.

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:

### In Scope
- Official Palimpsest License repositories (GitHub: palimpsest-license/*)
- License text and documentation systems
- Compliance and audit tooling (TOOLKIT_v0.4/*)
- Metadata validation and verification systems (METADATA_v0.4/*)
- Cryptographic attribution mechanisms
- Web infrastructure at palimpsest-license.org
- Integration examples and reference implementations
- Embed snippets and QR code generation tools
- API endpoints for license verification (if applicable)

### High Priority Vulnerabilities
Given the nature of our project, we prioritise vulnerabilities that could:
- Enable metadata stripping or manipulation (Clause 2.3 bypass)
- Compromise attribution chain integrity
- Facilitate unauthorised AI training data extraction
- Allow cryptographic signature forgery
- Circumvent Non-Interpretive (NI) consent mechanisms (Clause 1.2)
- Enable emotional lineage tampering
- Corrupt DAO governance voting mechanisms
- Permit quantum-proof traceability evasion

### Out of Scope
- Theoretical legal interpretations of license clauses
- Third-party services not directly controlled by this project
- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks against community members
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service attacks against public documentation sites

## Reporting Process

### How to Report

**Primary Contact:** security@palimpsest-license.org

**Secure Reporting Methods:**
1. Encrypted email using our PGP key (preferred)
   - Key: https://palimpsest-license.org/.well-known/pgp-key.txt
2. GitHub Security Advisory
   - https://github.com/palimpsest-license/palimpsest-license/security/advisories/new
3. Unencrypted email (if encryption not feasible)

### What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

**Essential Information:**
- Brief description of the vulnerability
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., injection, XSS, authentication bypass, cryptographic weakness)
- Affected component(s) and version(s)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept (if available)
- Potential impact assessment

**Optional Information:**
- Suggested remediation steps
- Any relevant code snippets or screenshots
- Your assessment of severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- CVE ID (if already assigned)

**Contact Details:**
- Your name or pseudonym (for acknowledgment)
- Preferred contact method
- Whether you wish to be publicly acknowledged

### What NOT to Include
- Do not include sensitive data from production systems
- Do not include personal information of other users
- Do not include credentials or API keys
- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly before coordination

## Our Commitment

### Response Timeline

**Initial Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours of report receipt
- Confirmation that we received your report
- Assignment of tracking identifier
- Primary point of contact introduction

**Status Update:** Within 7 calendar days
- Initial assessment of validity
- Severity classification
- Estimated timeline for resolution

**Resolution Timeline:**
- **Critical:** Within 30 days
- **High:** Within 60 days
- **Medium:** Within 90 days
- **Low:** Best effort basis

### Assessment Criteria

We assess vulnerabilities based on:
- **Impact:** Data confidentiality, integrity, availability
- **Exploitability:** Ease of exploitation, prerequisites
- **Scope:** Number of affected systems/users
- **Context:** Specific relevance to Palimpsest's mission (creator protection)

### Special Palimpsest Considerations

Given our focus on protecting creators from AI exploitation:
- Vulnerabilities enabling metadata tampering receive elevated severity
- Attribution chain weaknesses are treated as high priority
- Issues affecting emotional lineage protection are prioritised
- Cryptographic weaknesses in quantum-proof mechanisms are critical

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure model:

### Our Process
1. **Receipt & Verification:** We verify the vulnerability exists
2. **Assessment:** We determine severity and impact
3. **Development:** We develop and test a fix
4. **Notification:** We notify affected parties (if applicable)
5. **Release:** We deploy the fix and publish security advisory
6. **Disclosure:** We coordinate public disclosure with reporter

### Disclosure Timeline
- **Standard:** 90 days from initial report
- **Critical/Actively Exploited:** Expedited as appropriate
- **Complex Issues:** Extended timeline by mutual agreement

### Public Disclosure
After resolution, we will:
- Publish a security advisory (if warranted)
- Credit the reporter (if desired)
- Document lessons learned
- Update relevant documentation

## Researcher Rights & Safe Harbor

### Legal Safe Harbor

The Palimpsest Stewardship Council commits to NOT pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Follow this disclosure policy
- Do not violate privacy of users or data integrity
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond verification
- Do not demand payment or extortion
- Respect our coordinated disclosure timeline

### Permitted Actions
- Accessing your own test accounts/data
- Analysing publicly available code and documentation
- Testing in isolated environments
- Reporting vulnerabilities responsibly

### Prohibited Actions
- Accessing data belonging to other users
- Destroying or modifying data
- Executing denial of service attacks
- Social engineering of staff or community members
- Demanding payment for disclosure
- Public disclosure before coordination

## Recognition & Acknowledgment

### Security Researchers Hall of Honour

We maintain a public acknowledgment page at:
https://palimpsest-license.org/docs/security-acknowledgments.md

**We offer:**
- Public recognition (if desired)
- Detailed credit in security advisories
- Listing in our annual security report
- Special contributor badge (for significant findings)

**We do NOT offer:**
- Monetary bug bounties (we are a community project)
- Physical rewards or swag
- Employment guarantees

## Communication

### Languages
We accept vulnerability reports in:
- English (primary)
- Dutch (primary legal language)
- Other languages (best effort, may be slower)

### Confidentiality
All vulnerability reports are treated as confidential until coordinated public disclosure.

### Updates
Reporters will receive:
- Regular status updates (at minimum every 14 days)
- Notification when fix is developed
- Advance notice of public disclosure
- Copy of security advisory before publication

## Special Considerations for AI & LLM Context

Given that the Palimpsest License explicitly addresses AI training and usage:

### AI-Specific Vulnerabilities
We are particularly concerned with:
- LLM prompt injection that bypasses license compliance checks
- Training data extraction from licensed works
- Metadata stripping via AI processing pipelines
- Attribution laundering through generative AI systems
- Consent mechanism bypasses for NI systems

### Reporting AI-Related Issues
If your vulnerability involves:
- AI/LLM systems
- Training data handling
- Generative AI outputs
- Interpretive system consent mechanisms

Please include:
- Model/system involved
- Training data handling process
- Attribution preservation mechanisms
- Metadata flow diagrams

## Governance & Accountability

This policy is maintained by the **Palimpsest Stewardship Council** under the governance framework outlined in GOVERNANCE.md.

### Policy Updates
- Major changes require Council vote (5/7 supermajority)
- Minor clarifications can be made by security response team
- Community input welcomed via GitHub Discussions

### Escalation
Disputes or concerns can be escalated to:
- Full Stewardship Council
- governance@palimpsest-license.org
