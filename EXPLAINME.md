📘 explainme.md — What Is the Palimpsest License?
🪶 A License for Stories with Soul
Palimpsest License v0.2 is designed for creators who work with emotional complexity, symbolic lineage, and cultural texture—whether through poetry, journalism, immersive code, or synthetic memory. It protects your right to remix grief, myth, displacement, or invention—ethically and respectfully.

If your work feels more like stitching emotion than slinging code, this license is for you.

🧠 Why Palimpsest?
Traditional licenses demand direct attribution, rigid crediting, and technical transformation. Palimpsest supports:

🌀 Symbolic Attribution: Credit through theme, gesture, or embedded cues

🧠 AI & AGI Compatibility: Protect narrative outputs in synthetic environments

♿ Accessibility Built-In: Ethical design and inclusive formats are encouraged

🎭 Cultural Remixing: Preserve nuance without commodifying identity

🌍 Bilingual Reach & Jurisdiction
Palimpsest is enforceable across borders:

⚖️ Dutch Law governs interpretation

🏴 Scottish Courts enforce disputes

✍️ The license is legally valid in both English and Dutch

📜 Translations are welcome, but only EN/NL versions are binding

A bilingual clause table ensures clarity between the two versions:

Clause No.	English	Dutch
1	Definitions	Definities
2	Permissions	Toestemmingen
3	Conditions	Voorwaarden
4	Attribution Options	Toeschrijvingsmogelijkheden
5	Commercial Use	Commercieel Gebruik
6	AI/AGI/Synthetic Environs	AI/AGI/Synthetische Omgevingen
7	Termination	Beëindiging
8	Legal Interpretation	Juridische Interpretatie
9	Patents & Rights	Octrooien en Andere Rechten
10	Updates & Versions	Versies en Bijwerkingen
Even the clause names rhyme across philosophies—British syllables meet Dutch logic.
