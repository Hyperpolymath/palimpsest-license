The Palimpsest Licence is a living framework, governed by its community of creators, legal experts, and technologists. This document outlines the principles and processes for its stewardship and evolution.

== 1. The Palimpsest Stewardship Council

The Council is the primary governing body responsible for maintaining the integrity and future direction of the licence.

**Composition:** A rotating board of 7 members::
* 3 × Creator Representatives (elected by the community)
* 2 × Legal Experts (specialising in IP, Dutch, or Scottish law)
* 1 × Technologist (specialising in AI ethics or decentralised systems)
* 1 × Cultural Heritage Advocate

**Term:** 2 years, with staggered terms to ensure continuity.

**Responsibilities:**

* Ratifying new licence versions
* Arbitrating high-level compliance disputes (as outlined in the Compliance Toolkit)
* Overseeing the project's ethical framework

== 2. Decision-Making Process

Changes to the licence follow a transparent, structured process:

. **Proposal:** Any community member can submit a proposal via a GitHub Issue using the "Proposal" template.
. **Discussion:** The proposal is open for community discussion for a minimum of 30 days.
. **Council Review:** The Stewardship Council reviews the proposal and community feedback. A simple majority (4/7 votes) is required to move a proposal to the draft stage.
. **Drafting:** A working group is formed to draft the specific changes to the licence text or documentation.
. **Final Vote:** The final draft is presented to the Council. A supermajority (5/7 votes) is required for ratification.

== 3. Amending the Licence (New Versions)

**Major Versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0)**::
Reserved for fundamental changes to the licence's core principles. Requires a 90-day community review period and a 6/7 Council vote.

**Minor Versions (e.g., v0.3, v0.4)**::
Used for adding protections, clarifying language, or adapting to new technologies. Follows the standard decision-making process.

Our governance model is designed to be **responsive, transparent, and creator-centric**.
