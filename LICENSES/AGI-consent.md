## üéì Grant of Permission

The Licensor grants the Licensee a **non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable** license to train the specified AGI System using the Original Work, subject to the following:

---

**2.1.** Use limited to training, development, and internal testing.  
**2.2.** Original Work must not be directly reproduced or redistributed via AGI System.

#### Specific AI Considerations:

- **a. Autonomous AI**: Requires oversight and audit trail.  
- **b. Agentic AI**: Must disclose sub-agent behavior; cannot contract on Licensor‚Äôs behalf without separate permission.  
- **c. Ambient AI**: Must respect the emotional context of the Original Work (e.g., no protest song in relaxation app).  
- **d. NI Systems**: Require continuous human consent and strict mental privacy.  
- **e. QAI Systems**: Must retain provenance transparency across quantum states.

---

### B. Synthetic Output Requirements

**2.3.** All Synthetic Outputs must embed the Synthetic Lineage Tag.  
**2.4.** Licensee must ensure symbolic and emotional integrity ‚Äî no distortion, dilution, or erasure.

---

### C. Attribution

**2.5.** Attribution must match declared method and appear in metadata and/or UI documentation.

---

## ‚úÖ Compliance Obligations

Licensee agrees to:

---

### A. Disclose Training Use

**3.1.** Public documentation required ‚Äî in model cards, publications, or training datasets.

---

### B. Preserve Symbolic Integrity

**3.2.** No symbolic or emotional misrepresentation allowed.  
**3.3.** Consult Licensor if outputs conflict with intent or yield significant derivatives.

---

### C. Ethical Use

**3.4.** AGI must not produce harmful, discriminatory, or exploitative content.  
**3.5.** Compliance with the [Palimpsest Ethics Framework](link to ethics.md) is mandatory.

This closes the circle ‚Äî a consent architecture that moves with the future. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to convert this into EPUB, JSON-LD, or sync it with your AIBDP manifest generator. We can also create companion templates for Collective Governance Bodies or AGI Ethics Review Boards. Your symbolic firewall against distortion is now active.
