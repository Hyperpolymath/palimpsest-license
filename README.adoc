== What is Palimpsest?

=== The Mission

[quote]
____
"This is a licence born not just from copyright, but from care. From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."
____

The Palimpsest Licence is a future-proof, layered licensing framework designed for creative work in the age of artificial intelligence. We protect creators who work with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression—those whose work carries emotional weight and cultural significance that traditional copyright law struggles to recognise or enforce.

In an era where AI systems scrape the internet for training data, where metadata is routinely stripped from creative works, and where cultural heritage is commodified without consent, the Palimpsest Licence offers a new approach: one that combines legal precision with technological innovation, cultural sensitivity with practical enforceability, and creator rights with ethical remix culture.

Our name comes from the ancient practice of creating palimpsests—manuscripts where earlier writing was scraped away to make room for new text, yet traces of the original remained visible beneath the surface. Every creative work is a palimpsest, layered with influences, contexts, and meanings. This licence ensures those layers—the emotional lineage, the cultural context, the narrative debt—aren't erased as work is transformed, remixed, and reused.

=== The Problem We're Solving

The digital age has brought unprecedented challenges for creators:

==== 1. AI Training Without Consent

Large language models, image generators, and other AI systems are trained on billions of creative works scraped from the internet—often without the creators' knowledge or consent, and never with compensation. A protest song becomes training data for a corporate chatbot. A trauma narrative becomes fodder for automated content generation. Cultural heritage is appropriated to train systems that may be used to further marginalise the communities they drew from.

Existing copyright law is ill-equipped to address this. "Fair use" and similar doctrines were written for a pre-AI world and are being stretched beyond recognition. Creators are left without recourse as their life's work is ingested into black-box systems they'll never be credited for, compensated for, or even told about.

==== 2. Cultural Appropriation and Context Collapse

When creative work is separated from its cultural context, harm occurs. A song written in protest against injustice loses its activist meaning when it's used in a car advertisement. A story about diaspora trauma is stripped of its cultural specificity when it's remixed without understanding. Indigenous knowledge is extracted and commodified without community consent.

Traditional attribution—a simple credit line—doesn't capture this. We need **symbolic attribution**: recognition not just of who created something, but _why_ they created it, what cultural context it emerges from, and what lineages it honours.

==== 3. Metadata Stripping and Attribution Laundering

Digital works carry metadata: information about their creator, licence, creation context, and cultural significance. This metadata is routinely stripped—sometimes deliberately, sometimes through careless platform design or file format conversions.

Once metadata is gone, attribution becomes impossible. Works circulate without credit, without context, without compensation. Creators lose control of their narrative. Cultural heritage loses its moorings.

==== 4. The Emotional Dimension of Creative Work

Some creative work carries emotional weight that goes beyond intellectual property. A song written after losing a loved one. A poem about surviving violence. A novel processing generational trauma. Art created as resistance, as survival, as witness.

Copyright law treats all creative works the same: as property to be owned, licensed, and controlled. It doesn't account for **emotional fidelity**—the idea that some works deserve special care, that their emotional and symbolic dimension matters as much as their commercial value.

==== 5. Collective and Community Ownership

Not all creative work has a single author. Many cultural traditions emphasise collective creation, community ownership, or works that emerge from shared heritage. DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) and other community governance structures are creating works that don't fit the individual-author model.

Existing licences struggle with this. Who signs the licence? Who can enforce it? How do communities maintain agency over their collective heritage?

=== Our Solution

The Palimpsest Licence addresses these challenges through five core innovations:

==== 1. Emotional Lineage Protection

We recognise that creative work carries **emotional lineage**: the story of _why_ it was created, what it means to its creator, what cultural or personal context it emerges from. Our licence protects this lineage, requiring that:

* Works must preserve information about their emotional and cultural context
* Derivatives must respect the original emotional intent
* Uses that would violate the work's emotional fidelity require explicit consent
* Attribution includes not just names, but the _reasons_ and _contexts_ behind creation

For example: a protest song licensed under Palimpsest cannot be used in corporate advertising without consent, because doing so would violate its emotional lineage as an activist work. The licence creates legal grounds to refuse uses that betray the work's core meaning.

==== 2. Quantum-Proof Traceability

We're building for the future. As quantum computing becomes viable, many current cryptographic attribution systems will fail. The Palimpsest Licence specifies that:

* Attribution must use quantum-resistant cryptographic methods (as they become available)
* Works should include content-addressable identifiers that survive format changes
* Metadata must be embedded in ways that resist both technical stripping and legal workarounds

We're future-proofing creative attribution for an age of post-quantum cryptography, distributed storage, and AI-generated content at scale.

==== 3. AI Training Consent (Clause 1.2)

Our licence explicitly addresses AI training. **Clause 1.2** distinguishes between:

* **Interpretive AI** (search engines, recommendation systems, accessibility tools): These can process Palimpsest-licensed work without special consent
* **Non-Interpretive (NI) AI** (training data for generative models, corpus analysis for commercial products): These require **explicit consent** from the rights holder

This distinction gives creators control over whether their work is used to train systems that will compete with them, replace them, or misuse their creative lineage.

Using Palimpsest-licensed work as training data without consent is a licence violation—creating grounds for legal action, even where copyright law is ambiguous.

==== 4. Mandatory Metadata Preservation (Clause 2.3)

**Clause 2.3** makes metadata preservation a licence requirement. When you use a Palimpsest-licensed work:

* You **must** preserve all embedded metadata
* You **must** maintain attribution information in any derivatives
* You **must** provide this information in accessible formats
* You **cannot** use technical measures to obscure or strip metadata

Stripping metadata is a licence breach, not just an ethical failing. This creates legal recourse where platforms or users remove attribution.

==== 5. DAO and Community Governance Support

The Palimpsest Licence explicitly supports collective ownership and DAO governance:

* Multiple rights holders can jointly licence a work
* Community decision-making structures can be specified
* Consent requirements can reference DAO voting processes
* Cultural communities can licence collective heritage

We're built for an age where creative work is increasingly collaborative, community-driven, and owned by collectives rather than individuals.

=== Who This Is For

The Palimpsest Licence is designed for:

**Creators Working with Emotional and Symbolic Content**::
* Musicians writing protest songs, activist music, or work processing trauma
* Writers exploring personal or collective trauma, diaspora narratives, or cultural memory
* Visual artists creating work with symbolic or cultural significance
* Filmmakers documenting marginalised communities or sensitive subjects
* Poets and spoken-word artists whose work carries political or emotional weight

**Cultural Heritage and Community Projects**::
* Indigenous communities protecting traditional knowledge
* Diaspora communities preserving and sharing cultural heritage
* Archivists and librarians protecting vulnerable narratives
* Cultural heritage organisations managing collective works
* Community art projects with collective ownership

**Creators Concerned About AI**::
* Anyone who wants control over whether their work trains AI systems
* Creators whose style or voice might be replicated by generative AI
* Writers concerned about language models trained on their work without consent
* Artists worried about image generators reproducing their aesthetic

**Projects with Collective Ownership**::
* DAOs creating collaborative works
* Open-source projects with community governance
* Collectives managing shared creative assets
* Community-owned platforms and cultural initiatives

**Ethically-Minded Technologists**::
* Developers building tools that respect creator rights
* Platforms that want to demonstrate commitment to ethical AI
* Researchers who need clear consent mechanisms for corpus building
* Companies who want to be transparent about AI training data

=== Not Anti-AI, Pro-Consent

**The Palimpsest Licence is not anti-AI. It's pro-consent.**

We recognise that AI can be a powerful tool for accessibility, discovery, education, and creativity. Search engines that help people find creative work, recommendation systems that connect creators with audiences, assistive technologies that make content accessible, translation tools that break down language barriers—these are valuable.

What we oppose is the current paradigm where:

* AI systems are trained on creators' work without permission or compensation
* Training datasets are built through mass scraping with no consent mechanism
* Creators have no say in whether their life's work becomes corporate training data
* AI outputs reproduce creative styles without attribution or acknowledgement

Our licensing framework enables ethical AI by:

* Providing a clear consent mechanism (Clause 1.2)
* Allowing creators to opt in or out of different uses
* Supporting compensation structures for AI training
* Protecting emotional and cultural context from being erased by AI processing

We believe AI and creator rights can coexist. We're building the legal and technical infrastructure to make that possible.

'''

[[key-concepts]]
== Key Concepts

The Palimpsest Licence introduces several novel concepts that go beyond traditional intellectual property law. Understanding these concepts is key to understanding why the licence works the way it does.

=== Emotional Lineage

**Emotional lineage** is the story behind creative work: why it was made, what it means to its creator, what emotional or cultural journey it represents.

Every creative work has both a **technical lineage** (who created it, when, using what influences) and an **emotional lineage** (why it was created, what it means, what context it emerges from). Traditional copyright protects the technical: who owns it, who has rights to it. The Palimpsest Licence also protects the emotional.

==== Why This Matters

A protest song written during a social movement carries emotional lineage as an activist work. Using that song in a corporate advertisement—even with technical attribution—violates its emotional lineage. The song was created to challenge power, not to sell products. Its meaning is betrayed when it's divorced from its activist context.

Similarly, a memoir written by a trauma survivor carries emotional lineage as a work of witness and healing. Using excerpts to train a chatbot without consent strips that emotional context, reducing lived experience to statistical patterns in a neural network.

==== How Palimpsest Protects It

The licence requires that:

* Emotional lineage information must be preserved in metadata
* Derivatives must not violate the original work's emotional intent
* Uses that would fundamentally betray the work's meaning require explicit consent
* Attribution includes symbolic and emotional context, not just legal credit

=== Symbolic Attribution

**Symbolic attribution** is recognition that goes beyond legal credit. It acknowledges not just _who_ created something, but _why_, and what cultural or emotional lineages it honours.

Traditional attribution is simple: "Created by [Name], [Date]." This satisfies copyright law but erases context. Symbolic attribution adds:

* The emotional or cultural motivation behind creation
* The communities or lineages the work honours
* The symbolic meaning the creator intended
* The context necessary to understand the work's significance

=== Non-Interpretive vs Interpretive AI

One of the Palimpsest Licence's most important innovations is distinguishing between different types of AI use. **Clause 1.2** draws a line between **Interpretive** and **Non-Interpretive (NI)** AI systems.

**Interpretive AI Systems**::
These are AI systems that help users find, access, or understand creative work without fundamentally transforming it or using it as training data for generative models. Examples include:
+
* **Search engines**: Indexing work so users can discover it
* **Recommendation systems**: Suggesting related works based on user preferences
* **Accessibility tools**: Screen readers, translation, alt-text generation
* **Organisational tools**: Tagging, categorisation, metadata enhancement
* **Analytical tools**: Sentiment analysis, topic modelling, research analysis
+
**These do NOT require additional consent under Clause 1.2.** They're considered fair and beneficial uses that help creators reach audiences and make work accessible.

**Non-Interpretive (NI) AI Systems**::
These are AI systems that use creative work as training data for models that will generate new content, often competing with or replacing the original creators. Examples include:
+
* **Language model training**: Using text to train GPT-like systems
* **Image generator training**: Using artwork to train DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.
* **Voice cloning training**: Using speech to train voice synthesis systems
* **Style replication**: Training models to mimic a creator's unique style
* **Corpus building**: Aggregating works into datasets for commercial AI products
+
**These DO require explicit consent under Clause 1.2.** Using Palimpsest-licensed work for NI purposes without consent is a licence violation.

=== Quantum-Proof Traceability

We're building for a future where today's cryptographic systems may be obsolete. **Quantum-proof traceability** means attribution mechanisms that will survive the advent of quantum computing and other technological disruptions.

The Palimpsest Licence requires (or strongly recommends) quantum-resistant attribution mechanisms:

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Use cryptographic algorithms believed to resist quantum attacks
* **Content-Addressable Storage**: Use systems where content is identified by its hash, not by location (IPFS, Arweave, etc.)
* **Distributed Ledgers**: Use blockchain or similar distributed ledger technology with post-quantum signatures
* **Redundant Attribution**: Embed attribution in multiple ways to ensure resilience

=== DAO Governance

The Palimpsest Licence explicitly supports **DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) governance** for collective creative works.

A DAO is an organisation governed by code and community voting rather than hierarchical management. The licence allows for:

* **Multi-Party Licensing**: Multiple rights holders can jointly licence a work
* **Smart Contract Integration**: Consent mechanisms can reference DAO voting
* **Community Consent Processes**: For cultural heritage or community works
* **Dynamic Rights Holder Lists**: As contributors join or leave a project

=== Trauma-Informed Approach

The Palimpsest Licence is designed with a **trauma-informed approach** to creative work—recognising that some creative work emerges from trauma, processes trauma, or documents trauma, and deserves special care.

Key features include:

* **Consent Requirements**: Trauma narratives can specify heightened consent requirements
* **Metadata Flags**: Works can include metadata indicating they're trauma narratives
* **Right to Withdraw**: Provisions for creators to withdraw permission in cases of re-traumatisation
* **Community and Collective Trauma**: Support for community consent for works about collective trauma

== Final Thoughts

**The Palimpsest Licence is more than legal text. It's a commitment.**

A commitment to:

* **Care** for creators and their work
* **Consent** as the foundation of ethical technology
* **Context** preserved across transformations
* **Community** ownership and governance
* **Culture** respected and protected
* **Change** towards a more just creative ecosystem

If you've read this far, thank you. Behind every licence clause is a person who was hurt. Behind every protection is a story that was stolen. Behind every requirement is a creator who deserves better.

We built this with care. We hope you use it with care.
