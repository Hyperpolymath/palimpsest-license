== What is Palimpsest?

=== The Mission

> *"This is a license born not just from copyright, but from care. From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."*

The Palimpsest License is a future-proof, layered licensing framework designed for creative work in the age of artificial intelligence. We protect creators who work with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression—those whose work carries emotional weight and cultural significance that traditional copyright law struggles to recognise or enforce.

In an era where AI systems scrape the internet for training data, where metadata is routinely stripped from creative works, and where cultural heritage is commodified without consent, the Palimpsest License offers a new approach: one that combines legal precision with technological innovation, cultural sensitivity with practical enforceability, and creator rights with ethical remix culture.

Our name comes from the ancient practice of creating palimpsests—manuscripts where earlier writing was scraped away to make room for new text, yet traces of the original remained visible beneath the surface. Every creative work is a palimpsest, layered with influences, contexts, and meanings. This license ensures those layers—the emotional lineage, the cultural context, the narrative debt—aren't erased as work is transformed, remixed, and reused.

=== The Problem We're Solving

The digital age has brought unprecedented challenges for creators:

*1. AI Training Without Consent*

Large language models, image generators, and other AI systems are trained on billions of creative works scraped from the internet—often without the creators' knowledge or consent, and never with compensation. A protest song becomes training data for a corporate chatbot. A trauma narrative becomes fodder for automated content generation. Cultural heritage is appropriated to train systems that may be used to further marginalise the communities they drew from.

Existing copyright law is ill-equipped to address this. "Fair use" and similar doctrines were written for a pre-AI world and are being stretched beyond recognition. Creators are left without recourse as their life's work is ingested into black-box systems they'll never be credited for, compensated for, or even told about.

*2. Cultural Appropriation and Context Collapse*

When creative work is separated from its cultural context, harm occurs. A song written in protest against injustice loses its activist meaning when it's used in a car advertisement. A story about diaspora trauma is stripped of its cultural specificity when it's remixed without understanding. Indigenous knowledge is extracted and commodified without community consent.

Traditional attribution—a simple credit line—doesn't capture this. We need *symbolic attribution*: recognition not just of who created something, but *why* they created it, what cultural context it emerges from, and what lineages it honours.

*3. Metadata Stripping and Attribution Laundering*

Digital works carry metadata: information about their creator, license, creation context, and cultural significance. This metadata is routinely stripped—sometimes deliberately, sometimes through careless platform design or file format conversions.

Once metadata is gone, attribution becomes impossible. Works circulate without credit, without context, without compensation. Creators lose control of their narrative. Cultural heritage loses its moorings.

*4. The Emotional Dimension of Creative Work*

Some creative work carries emotional weight that goes beyond intellectual property. A song written after losing a loved one. A poem about surviving violence. A novel processing generational trauma. Art created as resistance, as survival, as witness.

Copyright law treats all creative works the same: as property to be owned, licensed, and controlled. It doesn't account for *emotional fidelity*—the idea that some works deserve special care, that their emotional and symbolic dimension matters as much as their commercial value.

*5. Collective and Community Ownership*

Not all creative work has a single author. Many cultural traditions emphasise collective creation, community ownership, or works that emerge from shared heritage. DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) and other community governance structures are creating works that don't fit the individual-author model.

Existing licenses struggle with this. Who signs the license? Who can enforce it? How do communities maintain agency over their collective heritage?

=== Our Solution

The Palimpsest License addresses these challenges through five core innovations:

*1. Emotional Lineage Protection*

We recognise that creative work carries *emotional lineage*: the story of *why* it was created, what it means to its creator, what cultural or personal context it emerges from. Our license protects this lineage, requiring that:

- Works must preserve information about their emotional and cultural context
- Derivatives must respect the original emotional intent
- Uses that would violate the work's emotional fidelity require explicit consent
- Attribution includes not just names, but the *reasons* and *contexts* behind creation

For example: a protest song licensed under Palimpsest cannot be used in corporate advertising without consent, because doing so would violate its emotional lineage as an activist work. The license creates legal grounds to refuse uses that betray the work's core meaning.

*2. Quantum-Proof Traceability*

We're building for the future. As quantum computing becomes viable, many current cryptographic attribution systems will fail. The Palimpsest License specifies that:

- Attribution must use quantum-resistant cryptographic methods (as they become available)
- Works should include content-addressable identifiers that survive format changes
- Metadata must be embedded in ways that resist both technical stripping and legal workarounds

We're future-proofing creative attribution for an age of post-quantum cryptography, distributed storage, and AI-generated content at scale.

*3. AI Training Consent (Clause 1.2)*

Our license explicitly addresses AI training. *Clause 1.2* distinguishes between:

- *Interpretive AI* (search engines, recommendation systems, accessibility tools): These can process Palimpsest-licensed work without special consent
- *Non-Interpretive (NI) AI* (training data for generative models, corpus analysis for commercial products): These require *explicit consent* from the rights holder

This distinction gives creators control over whether their work is used to train systems that will compete with them, replace them, or misuse their creative lineage.

Using Palimpsest-licensed work as training data without consent is a license violation—creating grounds for legal action, even where copyright law is ambiguous.

*4. Mandatory Metadata Preservation (Clause 2.3)*

*Clause 2.3* makes metadata preservation a license requirement. When you use a Palimpsest-licensed work:

- You *must* preserve all embedded metadata
- You *must* maintain attribution information in any derivatives
- You *must* provide this information in accessible formats
- You *cannot* use technical measures to obscure or strip metadata

Stripping metadata is a license breach, not just an ethical failing. This creates legal recourse where platforms or users remove attribution.

*5. DAO and Community Governance Support*

The Palimpsest License explicitly supports collective ownership and DAO governance:

- Multiple rights holders can jointly license a work
- Community decision-making structures can be specified
- Consent requirements can reference DAO voting processes
- Cultural communities can license collective heritage

We're built for an age where creative work is increasingly collaborative, community-driven, and owned by collectives rather than individuals.

=== Who This Is For

The Palimpsest License is designed for:

*Creators Working with Emotional and Symbolic Content*

- Musicians writing protest songs, activist music, or work processing trauma
- Writers exploring personal or collective trauma, diaspora narratives, or cultural memory
- Visual artists creating work with symbolic or cultural significance
- Filmmakers documenting marginalised communities or sensitive subjects
- Poets and spoken-word artists whose work carries political or emotional weight

*Cultural Heritage and Community Projects*

- Indigenous communities protecting traditional knowledge
- Diaspora communities preserving and sharing cultural heritage
- Archivists and librarians protecting vulnerable narratives
- Cultural heritage organisations managing collective works
- Community art projects with collective ownership

*Creators Concerned About AI*

- Anyone who wants control over whether their work trains AI systems
- Creators whose style or voice might be replicated by generative AI
- Writers concerned about language models trained on their work without consent
- Artists worried about image generators reproducing their aesthetic

*Projects with Collective Ownership*

- DAOs creating collaborative works
- Open-source projects with community governance
- Collectives managing shared creative assets
- Community-owned platforms and cultural initiatives

*Ethically-Minded Technologists*

- Developers building tools that respect creator rights
- Platforms that want to demonstrate commitment to ethical AI
- Researchers who need clear consent mechanisms for corpus building
- Companies who want to be transparent about AI training data

=== Not Anti-AI, Pro-Consent

*The Palimpsest License is not anti-AI. It's pro-consent.*

We recognise that AI can be a powerful tool for accessibility, discovery, education, and creativity. Search engines that help people find creative work, recommendation systems that connect creators with audiences, assistive technologies that make content accessible, translation tools that break down language barriers—these are valuable.

What we oppose is the current paradigm where:
- AI systems are trained on creators' work without permission or compensation
- Training datasets are built through mass scraping with no consent mechanism
- Creators have no say in whether their life's work becomes corporate training data
- AI outputs reproduce creative styles without attribution or acknowledgement

Our licensing framework enables ethical AI by:
- Providing a clear consent mechanism (Clause 1.2)
- Allowing creators to opt in or out of different uses
- Supporting compensation structures for AI training
- Protecting emotional and cultural context from being erased by AI processing

We believe AI and creator rights can coexist. We're building the legal and technical infrastructure to make that possible.

== Key Concepts

The Palimpsest License introduces several novel concepts that go beyond traditional intellectual property law. Understanding these concepts is key to understanding why the license works the way it does.

=== Emotional Lineage

*Emotional lineage* is the story behind creative work: why it was made, what it means to its creator, what emotional or cultural journey it represents.

Every creative work has both a *technical lineage* (who created it, when, using what influences) and an *emotional lineage* (why it was created, what it means, what context it emerges from). Traditional copyright protects the technical: who owns it, who has rights to it. The Palimpsest License also protects the emotional.

*Why This Matters:*

A protest song written during a social movement carries emotional lineage as an activist work. Using that song in a corporate advertisement—even with technical attribution—violates its emotional lineage. The song was created to challenge power, not to sell products. Its meaning is betrayed when it's divorced from its activist context.

Similarly, a memoir written by a trauma survivor carries emotional lineage as a work of witness and healing. Using excerpts to train a chatbot without consent strips that emotional context, reducing lived experience to statistical patterns in a neural network.

*How Palimpsest Protects It:*

The license requires that:
- Emotional lineage information must be preserved in metadata
- Derivatives must not violate the original work's emotional intent
- Uses that would fundamentally betray the work's meaning require explicit consent
- Attribution includes symbolic and emotional context, not just legal credit

*Example in Practice:*

Imagine a folk song written by a coal miner during a labour strike in 1926. The song's emotional lineage is:
- Created as resistance to exploitation
- Written from the perspective of working-class struggle
- Intended to build solidarity among miners
- Part of the cultural heritage of labour movements

If that song is licensed under Palimpsest, using it in an advertisement for a mining company would violate its emotional lineage. Even if the mining company offers payment and includes attribution, the use betrays the song's core meaning. Under Palimpsest, the rights holder can refuse such uses—or demand additional consent specifically acknowledging the contradiction.

*Emotional Lineage vs. Moral Rights:*

Some jurisdictions (particularly in civil law countries) recognise "moral rights" (*droits moraux*) that give creators the right to object to distortions or mutilations of their work. Emotional lineage extends this concept:

- *Moral rights* protect against modifications that harm the creator's reputation
- *Emotional lineage* protects against uses that betray the work's core meaning

Emotional lineage is broader: it's not just about the creator's reputation, but about the work's integrity as an emotional and cultural artefact.

=== Symbolic Attribution

*Symbolic attribution* is recognition that goes beyond legal credit. It acknowledges not just *who* created something, but *why*, and what cultural or emotional lineages it honours.

Traditional attribution is simple: "Created by [Name], [Date]." This satisfies copyright law but erases context. Symbolic attribution adds:
- The emotional or cultural motivation behind creation
- The communities or lineages the work honours
- The symbolic meaning the creator intended
- The context necessary to understand the work's significance

*Why This Matters:*

When a diasporic artist creates work exploring their cultural heritage, they're not creating in isolation. They're honouring their ancestors, their community, their cultural tradition. Simple attribution—"Created by [Artist Name]"—erases all of that.

Symbolic attribution might instead say:
> "Created by [Artist Name] as part of [Cultural Community], honouring [Ancestral Lineage], exploring [Specific Cultural Theme]."

This preserves the work's cultural moorings. It makes visible the relationships and responsibilities embedded in creation.

*How Palimpsest Implements It:*

The license requires that works include:
- Standard attribution (creator name, date, license)
- *Emotional attribution* (why the work was created)
- *Cultural attribution* (what communities or lineages it honours)
- *Symbolic attribution* (what meaning or significance it carries)

These are embedded in metadata using structured formats (JSON-LD, YAML) and must be preserved when works are reused or remixed.

*Example in Practice:*

A Scottish Gaelic poet writes a poem about language loss in Highland communities. Symbolic attribution would include:

```yaml
attribution:
  legal:
    creator: "Màiri NicLeòid"
    date: "2024-03-15"
    license: "Palimpsest v0.4"

  emotional:
    why: "Written in grief and resistance to language erasure"
    context: "Part of Scotland's Gaelic revival movement"

  cultural:
    community: "Scottish Gaelic speakers, Highland diaspora"
    lineage: "Honouring ancestors who kept Gaelic alive despite suppression"
    tradition: "Contemporary Gaelic poetry in the oral tradition"

  symbolic:
    meaning: "This poem is a act of linguistic survival"
    significance: "Each word in Gaelic is an act of cultural refusal"
```

When someone uses or remixes this poem, they must preserve this attribution. They must acknowledge it's not just a poem—it's an act of cultural resistance. They must respect that it emerges from and honours a specific community's struggle.

*Ambient Attribution:*

Symbolic attribution can be *ambient*: woven into the work itself rather than separate credits. A film might include visual symbols acknowledging its cultural lineage. A song might reference its influences lyrically. This is valid symbolic attribution under Palimpsest—it doesn't have to be a separate metadata block.

=== Non-Interpretive vs Interpretive AI

One of the Palimpsest License's most important innovations is distinguishing between different types of AI use. *Clause 1.2* draws a line between *Interpretive* and *Non-Interpretive (NI)* AI systems.

*Interpretive AI Systems:*

These are AI systems that help users find, access, or understand creative work without fundamentally transforming it or using it as training data for generative models. Examples include:

- *Search engines*: Indexing work so users can discover it
- *Recommendation systems*: Suggesting related works based on user preferences
- *Accessibility tools*: Screen readers, translation, alt-text generation
- *Organisational tools*: Tagging, categorisation, metadata enhancement
- *Analytical tools*: Sentiment analysis, topic modelling, research analysis

*These do NOT require additional consent under Clause 1.2.* They're considered fair and beneficial uses that help creators reach audiences and make work accessible.

*Non-Interpretive (NI) AI Systems:*

These are AI systems that use creative work as training data for models that will generate new content, often competing with or replacing the original creators. Examples include:

- *Language model training*: Using text to train GPT-like systems
- *Image generator training*: Using artwork to train DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.
- *Voice cloning training*: Using speech to train voice synthesis systems
- *Style replication*: Training models to mimic a creator's unique style
- *Corpus building*: Aggregating works into datasets for commercial AI products

*These DO require explicit consent under Clause 1.2.* Using Palimpsest-licensed work for NI purposes without consent is a license violation.

*The Distinction:*

The key difference is:
- *Interpretive AI* helps users engage with the original work
- *Non-Interpretive AI* uses the work to create substitutes or derivatives

Interpretive AI preserves creator agency: the work remains attributed to its creator, and the AI helps people find and access it. Non-Interpretive AI erases creator agency: the work becomes fuel for systems that may replace the creator, erase their style, or compete with their livelihood.

*Why This Matters:*

Current copyright law doesn't distinguish between these uses. Courts treat "AI training" as a monolithic category, often ruling it "transformative fair use." This erases the meaningful difference between a search engine indexing your work (helpful) and a generative model training on your work to replace you (exploitative).

The Palimpsest License makes this distinction explicit and enforceable. Creators can say: "Yes to search engines and accessibility tools. No to training data for systems that will mimic my style without credit or compensation."

*Obtaining NI Consent:*

If you want to use Palimpsest-licensed work for Non-Interpretive AI training, you must:

1. Contact the rights holder (contact information should be in metadata)
2. Explain exactly what you're doing: what model, what purpose, what commercial use
3. Negotiate terms: compensation, attribution requirements, usage limits
4. Get explicit written consent
5. Honour the terms of that consent

Many creators may consent—especially if fairly compensated and properly attributed. The license simply ensures they have the right to decide, rather than having their work taken without permission.

*Technical Detection:*

The license encourages including technical measures to detect NI use:
- Watermarking or fingerprinting that survives AI training
- Audit logs when AI systems access licensed works
- Consent verification mechanisms in training pipelines

These are optional but recommended. They make enforcement more practical.

=== Quantum-Proof Traceability

We're building for a future where today's cryptographic systems may be obsolete. *Quantum-proof traceability* means attribution mechanisms that will survive the advent of quantum computing and other technological disruptions.

*The Problem:*

Most current digital attribution relies on cryptographic signatures (e.g., digital signatures, hash functions, blockchain records). Many of these systems use algorithms that will be broken by quantum computers:

- RSA encryption: vulnerable to Shor's algorithm on quantum computers
- Elliptic curve cryptography: vulnerable to quantum attacks
- Current blockchain signatures: many will fail in a post-quantum world

If attribution relies on these systems, it will become unverifiable once quantum computers are widely available (estimated 10-20 years, possibly sooner).

*The Solution:*

The Palimpsest License requires (or strongly recommends) quantum-resistant attribution mechanisms:

*1. Post-Quantum Cryptography:*

Use cryptographic algorithms believed to resist quantum attacks:
- Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., Crystals-Kyber, Crystals-Dilithium)
- Hash-based signatures (e.g., SPHINCS+)
- Code-based cryptography
- Multivariate cryptography

These are already being standardised by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) for post-quantum use.

*2. Content-Addressable Storage:*

Use systems where content is identified by its hash, not by location:
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- Arweave
- Storj
- Content-addressed storage in general

These systems create immutable links between content and attribution, surviving platform changes and link rot.

*3. Distributed Ledgers:*

Use blockchain or similar distributed ledger technology with post-quantum signatures:
- Attribution records on distributed ledgers
- Timestamping services that will transition to post-quantum algorithms
- Decentralised storage networks

*4. Redundant Attribution:*

Embed attribution in multiple ways:
- In metadata (JSON-LD, EXIF, ID3 tags)
- In the work itself (watermarks, steganography)
- In external registries (copyright registries, blockchain records)
- In human-readable form (embedded credits in the work)

If one system fails, others remain.

*Why This Matters:*

Creative works can last centuries. A song written today might be sung for generations. A novel might be read by your great-great-grandchildren. Attribution needs to last as long as the work.

If we build attribution systems on cryptography that will be broken in 20 years, we're setting up future attribution failures. Works will circulate without verifiable attribution. Creators will be forgotten. Cultural lineages will be lost.

Quantum-proof traceability ensures that attribution survives technological change. It's future-proofing creative credit.

*Practical Implementation:*

You don't need to be a cryptography expert to comply. The license provides:
- Recommended tools and services for quantum-resistant attribution
- Metadata templates that support future algorithm upgrades
- Guidelines for embedding attribution that will survive format changes

As post-quantum systems become standard, Palimpsest-licensed works will be ready.

=== DAO Governance

The Palimpsest License explicitly supports *DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) governance* for collective creative works.

*What is a DAO?*

A DAO is an organisation governed by code and community voting rather than hierarchical management:
- Rules are encoded in smart contracts
- Decisions are made by token holders voting on proposals
- Execution is automated and transparent
- Governance is decentralised across the community

DAOs are increasingly used for collective projects: open-source software, community media, collaborative art, cultural heritage preservation.

*Why Creative Work Needs DAO Support:*

Not all creative work has a single author:
- Collaborative media projects (podcasts, documentary series, community archives)
- Open-source creative tools and content
- Community-owned cultural assets
- Collective heritage of diasporic or Indigenous communities
- Works with evolving authorship as contributors come and go

Traditional licenses assume a single rights holder who can grant or deny permission. This doesn't fit collective ownership models.

*How Palimpsest Supports DAOs:*

The license allows for:

*1. Multi-Party Licensing:*

Multiple rights holders can jointly license a work. The license can specify:
- How many votes are needed to grant permissions
- How disputes are resolved
- How new contributors gain rights
- How rights holders can leave without disrupting the project

*2. Smart Contract Integration:*

Consent mechanisms can reference DAO voting:
> "Permission for Non-Interpretive AI use requires approval by 66% vote of the [DAO Name] governance token holders."

This makes consent verifiable on-chain and enforceable through both the license and the DAO's smart contracts.

*3. Community Consent Processes:*

For cultural heritage or community works, consent can require community consultation:
> "Permission for commercial use requires consultation with [Community Name] through their established decision-making process."

This respects that some creative works belong to communities, not individuals, and decisions should involve community voice.

*4. Dynamic Rights Holder Lists:*

As contributors join or leave a project, the list of rights holders can update:
- New contributors can be added by DAO vote
- Departed contributors can transfer rights to the collective
- Rights can vest over time (e.g., "become full rights holder after 6 months of contribution")

*Example in Practice:*

A community podcast collective uses a DAO to govern their work:

```yaml
rights_holders:
  governance: "PodcastDAO"
  voting_mechanism: "Snapshot governance at snapshot.org/#/podcast-dao"
  consent_threshold: "66% approval by token holders"

permissions:
  standard_use: "Allowed per license terms"
  commercial_use: "Requires DAO vote (66% threshold)"
  NI_AI_training: "Requires DAO vote (75% threshold)"

metadata_updates:
  process: "Proposed via DAO forum, voted on-chain"
  required_votes: "Simple majority (50%+)"
```

Anyone wanting to use the podcast for AI training would:
1. Contact the DAO via their specified channel
2. Submit a proposal to the DAO governance process
3. The community votes
4. If approved, the smart contract records consent
5. The user can proceed, with consent verifiably on-chain

*Benefits:*

- *Transparency*: All decisions are public and auditable
- *Community agency*: Those who contribute have say in how work is used
- *Automated enforcement*: Smart contracts can restrict use to approved parties
- *Resilience*: No single point of failure; the collective continues even as individuals leave

=== Trauma-Informed Approach

The Palimpsest License is designed with a *trauma-informed approach* to creative work—recognising that some creative work emerges from trauma, processes trauma, or documents trauma, and deserves special care.

*What Does Trauma-Informed Mean?*

A trauma-informed approach:
- Recognises the prevalence and impact of trauma
- Prioritises safety, trustworthiness, and empowerment
- Resists re-traumatisation through insensitive handling
- Centres the agency and consent of trauma survivors
- Acknowledges that trauma impacts individuals and communities

*Why Creative Work Needs This:*

Many creators process personal or collective trauma through their work:
- Memoirs and autobiographical writing about abuse, violence, or loss
- Music and poetry emerging from grief or survival
- Visual art documenting historical atrocities or systemic oppression
- Film and media created by marginalised communities about their experiences
- Oral histories and testimony from survivors of genocide, war, or displacement

When this work is used without consent, stripped of context, or exploited commercially, it can re-traumatise creators and communities. Using a sexual assault survivor's memoir to train a chatbot without consent isn't just a copyright violation—it's an ethical violation that treats trauma as data.

*How Palimpsest Protects Trauma Narratives:*

*1. Consent Requirements:*

Trauma narratives licensed under Palimpsest can specify heightened consent requirements:
- Commercial use requires explicit discussion of the work's trauma context
- AI training requires acknowledgement that this is trauma narrative, not just data
- Remixes or derivatives require sensitivity to the original emotional content

*2. Metadata Flags:*

Works can include metadata indicating they're trauma narratives:

```yaml
content_warnings:
  - "sexual violence"
  - "childhood abuse"
  - "suicide"

trauma_informed: true

special_handling:
  - "This work is a survivor's testimony"
  - "Use requires understanding of trauma-informed ethics"
  - "Contact creator before any derivative use"
```

This alerts users that special care is needed.

*3. Right to Withdraw:*

The license includes provisions for creators to withdraw permission in cases of:
- Re-traumatisation from how work is being used
- Uses that violate the work's integrity as trauma processing
- Exploitative or insensitive commercial use

This gives creators ongoing agency, not just a one-time licensing decision.

*4. Community and Collective Trauma:*

For works about collective trauma (genocide, colonisation, systemic oppression), the license supports community consent:
- Use may require consultation with affected communities
- Cultural sensitivity review may be mandatory
- Communities can specify how their traumatic histories should (and should not) be used

*Example in Practice:*

A writer publishes a memoir about surviving domestic violence, licensed under Palimpsest. The license specifies:

- ✅ *Allowed*: Sharing for education, support groups, advocacy, research with proper ethics review
- ⚠️ *Requires consent*: Excerpts in media, commercial publication, inclusion in anthologies
- ❌ *Not allowed without explicit consent*: AI training, decontextualised quotation, use in content that minimises or denies domestic violence

If a language model wants to train on this memoir, they must:
1. Contact the author
2. Explain the use case
3. Discuss how trauma context will be respected (or acknowledge it will be lost)
4. Negotiate consent with full understanding of the ethical dimensions

The author can refuse if they feel AI training would treat their trauma as mere data. The license gives legal backing to that refusal.

*Benefits:*

- *Respects creator agency*: Survivors control how their trauma narratives are used
- *Prevents exploitation*: Can't be used for profit without consent and proper context
- *Preserves context*: Trauma narratives aren't stripped of their meaning
- *Enables healing*: Creators can share their work without losing control of it
- *Supports advocacy*: Work can be used for education and change while preventing harmful uses

=== Verification

How to verify that a work is legitimately licensed under Palimpsest:

*1. Check for License Text*

Look for:
- `LICENSE.md` or `LICENTIE.md` file
- License badge in README
- Copyright notice mentioning Palimpsest v0.4

*2. Check Metadata*

Look for:
- `.palimpsest.yml` or `.palimpsest.json`
- Embedded metadata in files (ID3, EXIF, etc.)
- Attribution file or page

*3. Verify Contact Information*

Legitimate Palimpsest licenses should include:
- Creator contact information
- Way to request permissions
- Link to palimpsest-license.org or official license text

*4. Check Attribution Chain*

If the work is a derivative:
- Should include attribution to original creator
- Should preserve original metadata
- Should link to original source

*5. Use Validation Tools*

We provide tools to verify Palimpsest metadata:

```bash
= Install validator
npm install -g palimpsest-validator

= Validate a project
palimpsest-validate /path/to/project

= Check metadata
palimpsest-check-metadata .palimpsest.yml
```

*6. Check On-Chain Records (for DAO projects)*

If using blockchain verification:
- Check the specified contract address
- Verify vote records match claimed permissions
- Confirm transaction history

*Red Flags (Potential Misuse):*

- ❌ No contact information for permissions
- ❌ Metadata stripped or incomplete
- ❌ Claims Palimpsest license but violates its terms (e.g., strips attribution from derivatives)
- ❌ No link to official license text
- ❌ Contradictory terms (e.g., "Palimpsest license, no attribution required")

== Features

What makes Palimpsest unique among open licenses.

=== Bilingual Framework

The Palimpsest License operates in *two languages with clear primacy*:

- *Dutch (Nederlands)*: Legally binding in the Netherlands
- *English*: Informative, for global accessibility

*Why Bilingual?*

1. *Legal Clarity*: The Netherlands has strong creator protection laws. Having a Dutch version allows Palimpsest to leverage Dutch jurisprudence on moral rights, personality rights, and cultural heritage protection.

2. *Global Accessibility*: Most creators and technologists work in English. An English version ensures the license is understandable and usable worldwide.

3. *Cultural Respect*: Many diasporic communities are multilingual. Offering licenses in multiple languages respects linguistic diversity and accessibility.

*How It Works:*

- The *Dutch version* (`palimpsest-v0.4.nl.md`) is the legally binding text for disputes in Dutch courts
- The *English version* (`palimpsest-v0.4.md`) is informative and used globally
- Both versions are kept in sync (see `docs/bilingual-map.md`)
- If there's a conflict between versions, the Dutch version prevails in Dutch jurisdiction, but both are considered in good faith elsewhere

*Future Languages:*

We plan to add:
- *Scottish Gaelic* (for Scottish jurisdiction variants)
- *Spanish* (for Latin American adoption)
- *French* (for Francophone communities)
- *Swahili* (for East African communities)
- Community-contributed translations verified by native speakers

*Translation Process:*

All translations are:
- Done by native speakers with legal expertise
- Reviewed by the Stewardship Council
- Verified for legal equivalence with the original
- Documented in the bilingual map

We don't use machine translation for legal text—only human translators who understand both the language and the legal concepts.

=== Multi-Jurisdiction Support

While primarily based in *Dutch law*, Palimpsest is designed to work across multiple legal systems.

*Primary Jurisdiction: Netherlands*

Why the Netherlands?
- Strong moral rights (*persoonlijkheidsrechten*)
- Robust cultural heritage protection
- Progressive approach to digital rights
- EU membership (GDPR, Copyright Directive compliance)
- Bilingual legal tradition (Dutch/English common in Dutch law)

*Comparative Analysis:*

We provide guidance for how Palimpsest interacts with:

- *United Kingdom*: How Palimpsest works under UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
- *Scotland*: Special considerations for Scots law and cultural heritage
- *United States*: How Palimpsest interacts with US fair use and DMCA
- *European Union*: GDPR, Copyright Directive, Digital Services Act implications
- *International*: Berne Convention compliance and international enforcement

See `docs/jurisdiction-comparison.md` for detailed analysis.

*Enforcement Across Borders:*

- Palimpsest is designed to be enforceable under *Berne Convention* reciprocity
- License violations are contract violations, enforceable where the violator operates
- Metadata preservation requirements align with GDPR in EU
- International arbitration provisions for cross-border disputes

*Cultural and Legal Pluralism:*

We recognise that law isn't universal:
- Indigenous communities may have customary law that supersedes state law
- Different jurisdictions balance creator rights vs. public interest differently
- Cultural norms around attribution vary

Palimpsest is designed to be *symbolically meaningful* even where strict legal enforcement is uncertain. The license creates community standards and norms, not just legal obligations.

=== AI Training Consent

*Clause 1.2* is Palimpsest's most distinctive feature: explicit consent requirements for AI training.

*How It Works:*

1. *Interpretive AI*: Allowed without special consent
   - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
   - Recommendation systems (YouTube suggestions, Spotify recommendations)
   - Accessibility tools (screen readers, translation, alt-text generation)
   - Organisation tools (tagging, archiving, metadata enhancement)

2. *Non-Interpretive AI*: Requires explicit consent
   - Training data for language models (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
   - Training data for image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
   - Training data for voice cloning or music generation
   - Corpus building for commercial AI products
   - Style replication systems

*Obtaining Consent:*

To use Palimpsest work for NI AI training:

```
1. Identify the rights holder (check metadata, LICENSE file, or ATTRIBUTION file)
2. Contact them via specified method (email, web form, DAO proposal, etc.)
3. Explain:
   - What model you're training
   - What the model will be used for
   - Commercial vs. research use
   - How attribution will (or won't) be preserved
4. Negotiate terms:
   - Compensation (if any)
   - Attribution requirements
   - Usage restrictions
   - Audit rights
5. Get explicit written consent
6. Document consent (on-chain for DAOs, email for individuals, contract for orgs)
7. Honour the terms
```

*Why This Matters:*

Current AI training operates on an "ask forgiveness, not permission" model. Companies scrape billions of works, train models, and commercialise them before creators even know their work was used.

Palimpsest flips this: *permission first, use second*. It creates legal grounds to refuse AI training uses and to negotiate fair terms when you consent.

*Technical Enforcement:*

We're building tools to make this practical:

- *Robots.txt extensions*: Declare NI restrictions in machine-readable format
- *AI.txt*: Specify AI training policies at `/.well-known/ai.txt`
- *Header-based signalling*: HTTP headers declaring license terms
- *Watermarking*: Embed invisible markers that survive AI training
- *Audit mechanisms*: Tools to detect when your work appears in training datasets

*Industry Adoption:*

We're in dialogue with:
- *AI companies*: Anthropic, OpenAI, Stability AI, Hugging Face
- *Creative platforms*: DeviantArt, ArtStation, GitHub
- *Standards bodies*: Seeking to make NI consent a web standard
- *Legal advocates*: Partnering with creator rights organisations

Our goal is to make Palimpsest-style consent the industry norm, not the exception.

=== Metadata Preservation

*Clause 2.3* requires that all metadata—attribution, licensing, cultural context—be preserved when works are used or shared.

*What Counts as Metadata:*

- *Technical metadata*: Creator name, date, license, version
- *Emotional metadata*: Why it was created, what it means
- *Cultural metadata*: What communities it honours, what lineages it represents
- *Usage metadata*: Permissions granted, consent records, prior uses

*How to Preserve It:*

*For Files:*
- Embed in file headers (EXIF for images, ID3 for audio, PDF metadata for documents)
- Include in sidecar files (`.palimpsest.yml` alongside the work)
- Include in project files (README.md, ATTRIBUTION.md)

*For Platforms:*
- Display attribution information with the work
- Provide metadata in APIs and downloads
- Don't strip metadata during processing
- Export metadata with user content

*For Derivatives:*
- Include original attribution + your own
- Preserve emotional and cultural context from original
- Link back to original source
- Document how the derivative relates to the original

*Technical Standards:*

We use:
- *JSON-LD*: Machine-readable structured data
- *YAML*: Human-readable metadata files
- *Schema.org*: Standard vocabularies where applicable
- *Custom schemas*: Palimpsest-specific fields for emotional lineage, etc.

*Example:*

Original work has this metadata:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Echoes of Home",
  "creator": "Amara Okonkwo",
  "license": "https://palimpsest-license.org/v0.4/",
  "dateCreated": "2025-03-15",

  "palimpsest": {
    "emotional_lineage": "Written in grief and hope during my first year in diaspora",
    "cultural_context": "Nigerian diaspora poetry",
    "symbolic_attribution": "Honouring my grandmother's stories"
  }
}
```

A derivative must preserve this and add:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Echoes Remixed",
  "creator": "DJ Soundscapes",
  "license": "https://palimpsest-license.org/v0.4/",
  "dateCreated": "2025-06-20",

  "isBasedOn": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Echoes of Home",
    "creator": "Amara Okonkwo",
    "url": "https://amara-poetry.org/echoes-of-home",

    "palimpsest": {
      "emotional_lineage": "Written in grief and hope during my first year in diaspora",
      "cultural_context": "Nigerian diaspora poetry",
      "symbolic_attribution": "Honouring my grandmother's stories"
    }
  },

  "palimpsest": {
    "derivative_note": "Remix created to explore the musical rhythms in Amara's words",
    "respect_for_original": "Preserving the diaspora context and emotional weight",
    "cultural_context": "Electronic music, UK diaspora soundscapes"
  }
}
```

*Enforcement:*

Stripping metadata is a license violation. If someone removes attribution, you can:
- Send a cease-and-desist requiring restoration
- Invoke platform DMCA (or equivalent) takedown processes
- Pursue legal action for contract breach
- Use technical measures to detect and report stripped metadata

=== Cultural Sensitivity

Palimpsest is designed with deep cultural sensitivity, recognising that creative work often emerges from and belongs to communities, not just individuals.

*Key Features:*

*1. Community Consent:*

For works representing cultural heritage or collective knowledge:
- Consent can require community consultation
- Decision-making can involve cultural leaders or elders
- Communities can specify appropriate and inappropriate uses

*2. Diaspora Narrative Protection:*

Special provisions for diaspora communities:
- Recognition that diaspora work honours ancestral lineages
- Protection against uses that would betray cultural context
- Support for multilingual and cross-cultural attribution

*3. Trauma-Informed Language:*

Documentation uses trauma-informed language:
- Content warnings for sensitive examples
- Respect for survivors and vulnerable communities
- Acknowledgement that some work processes collective trauma

*4. Indigenous Knowledge:*

Support for Indigenous knowledge protocols:
- Community ownership structures
- Seasonal or ceremonial use restrictions
- Respect for cultural protocols around sharing

*5. Linguistic Diversity:*

Multilingual support:
- License available in multiple languages
- Attribution can be in the creator's language
- Cultural terms don't have to be translated if that would lose meaning

*Example:*

A Scottish Gaelic-language archive licenses its material under Palimpsest:

```yaml
attribution:
  cultural:
    community: "Scottish Gaelic speakers, particularly Lewis and Harris"
    lineage: "Oral tradition maintained through generations"
    language_note: "Gaelic terms preserved untranslated"

permissions:
  standard_use: "Educational, cultural preservation, language learning"
  requires_consent:
    - "Commercial use"
    - "Use in media that diminishes Gaelic culture"
    - "Translation without Gaelic speaker consultation"

cultural_protocols:
  - "Respect that Gaelic is not just a language but a worldview"
  - "Translations should involve native speakers"
  - "Don't use to represent 'Celtic mysticism' or other stereotypes"
```

=== Accessibility

Palimpsest is committed to accessibility at every level.

*License Accessibility:*

- *Plain language summaries*: Legal text is complex; we provide plain language summaries
- *Multiple formats*: Markdown, HTML, PDF, plain text
- *Screen reader friendly*: Semantic HTML, alt text, clear structure
- *Translation*: Available in multiple languages

*Documentation Accessibility:*

- *Clear structure*: Headings, lists, tables for easy navigation
- *Concrete examples*: Abstract concepts illustrated with real scenarios
- *Visual descriptions*: Diagrams described in text
- *WCAG 2.1 AA compliance*: Web content meets accessibility standards

*Tooling Accessibility:*

Our validation and compliance tools:
- Work from command line (accessible for screen reader users)
- Provide clear error messages
- Don't require GUI interaction
- Support multiple input formats

*Format Diversity:*

Creative works can be licensed in any format:
- Text: books, poetry, articles, documentation
- Audio: music, podcasts, spoken word, audiobooks
- Visual: paintings, photographs, illustrations, comics
- Video: films, animations, video essays
- Interactive: games, web experiences, installations
- Code: software, scripts, algorithms

*Accessible Attribution:*

Attribution can be provided in multiple ways:
- Text (for screen readers)
- Audio (for blind or low-vision creators)
- Visual (embedded in images or video)
- Structured data (machine-readable)

We don't require one format—use what works for your work and your audience.

=== Offline-First Tooling

All Palimpsest tools work offline. No network required.

*Why Offline-First:*

1. *Accessibility*: Not everyone has reliable internet
2. *Privacy*: Validation shouldn't require sending data to remote servers
3. *Resilience*: Tools should work even if palimpsest-license.org is down
4. *Independence*: Creators shouldn't depend on centralised infrastructure

*What Works Offline:*

- *License text*: Distributed as static files, no external dependencies
- *Validation tools*: Check Palimpsest compliance without network calls
- *Metadata generators*: Create `.palimpsest.yml` files locally
- *Documentation*: All docs available as static files
- *Examples*: All examples and templates included in repository

*Installation:*

```bash
= Clone entire repository for offline use
git clone https://github.com/palimpsest-license/palimpsest-license
cd palimpsest-license

= Install dependencies (one-time, requires network)
npm install

= From now on, everything works offline
npm run validate
npm run build
npm test
```

*Nix Flake:*

For maximum reproducibility and offline capability:

```bash
= Enable Nix flakes
nix flake check

= Build offline (after first fetch)
nix build

= Development shell (all tools available)
nix develop
```

*No CDN Dependencies:*

Unlike many modern web projects, Palimpsest doesn't require:
- CDN-hosted libraries
- Remote fonts
- External stylesheets
- Analytics scripts
- Tracking pixels

Everything needed is in the repository. Clone it once, use it forever.

=== Decision-Making Process

Changes to Palimpsest follow a transparent, community-driven process:

*1. Proposal Phase*

Anyone can submit a proposal:
- Open a GitHub Issue using "Proposal" template
- Describe the change you want (new clause, clarification, etc.)
- Explain why it's needed
- Propose specific text if possible

*2. Community Discussion (Minimum 30 Days)*

The community discusses:
- Is this change needed?
- How would it affect existing users?
- Are there better alternatives?
- What are the implications?

Discussion happens:
- In the GitHub Issue
- In community forums
- In scheduled community calls (if major change)

*3. Council Review*

Stewardship Council reviews:
- Community feedback
- Legal implications
- Technical feasibility
- Cultural sensitivity
- Alignment with project values

Vote required: *4/7 (simple majority)* to move forward

*4. Drafting Phase*

If approved, a working group drafts the change:
- Composed of relevant experts
- May include community volunteers
- Council provides oversight
- Iterative draft → feedback → revision

*5. Final Review & Vote*

Draft presented to Council and community:
- Minimum 14 days for final review
- Community can provide input
- Council votes: *5/7 (supermajority)* required for ratification

*6. Implementation*

If ratified:
- Change merged into next version
- CHANGELOG updated
- Documentation updated
- Community notified
- Transition period (if needed) begins

*Version Types:*

- *Major Versions (v1.0, v2.0)*: Fundamental changes
  - 90-day review period
  - 6/7 Council vote required
  - Extensive community consultation

- *Minor Versions (v0.4, v0.5)*: Additions and clarifications
  - 30-day review period
  - 5/7 Council vote required
  - Standard process

- *Patch Versions (v0.4.1)*: Bug fixes, typos, non-substantive changes
  - 7-day review period
  - 4/7 Council vote (or maintainer approval for trivial changes)

=== TPCF Perimeter 3

The Palimpsest License project operates under *Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF) Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox*.

*What is TPCF?*

TPCF is a framework for defining contribution and access policies based on risk and sensitivity:

- *Perimeter 1 (Kernel)*: Core infrastructure, highest security, restricted access
- *Perimeter 2 (Shell)*: Important but less critical, maintainer access
- *Perimeter 3 (Community)*: Public, community-driven, open collaboration

*Why Perimeter 3?*

The Palimpsest License is:
- *Public by design*: Open licensing framework
- *Benefits from community*: Diverse perspectives improve the license
- *Low security risk*: Legal text, not secret infrastructure
- *High transparency value*: Open governance builds trust

Therefore: *Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)*

*Access Control:*

- *Read*: Public (anyone can view)
- *Write*: Maintainers (approved contributors)
- *Governance*: Stewardship Council (elected/appointed)

*Review Requirements:*

| Change Type | Review Needed | Timeline |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Typo fixes | 1 maintainer | Immediate |
| Documentation | 1 maintainer | 1-7 days |
| Code/tools | 1-2 maintainers | 1-14 days |
| License clarifications | Council 4/7 | 30 days |
| New clauses | Council 5/7 | 30 days |
| Major versions | Council 6/7 | 90 days |

*Cultural Sensitivity Perimeter:*

For changes affecting cultural content:
- *Diaspora narratives*: Cultural Heritage Advocate must review
- *Trauma examples*: Trauma-informed review required
- *Indigenous content*: Community consultation mandatory
- *Multilingual*: Native speaker review for translations

See `TPCF.md` for full framework.

*Documentation and Examples: Palimpsest v0.4*

All documentation, guides, examples, and creative content are licensed under the *Palimpsest License v0.4*:
- Use, remix, and share with attribution
- Preserve emotional and cultural context
- AI training requires consent
- Respect the care embedded in this work

See `LICENSES/v0.4/palimpsest-v0.4.md` for full license text.

*Why Dual License?*

- *Code*: MIT ensures maximum reusability for technical tools
- *Docs*: Palimpsest demonstrates the license in practice ("dogfooding")
- *Clarity*: Different materials have different needs and audiences

*What This Means for You:*

If you want to:
- *Use our validation tools in your platform*: MIT License applies, very permissive
- *Adapt our documentation for your project*: Palimpsest License applies, preserve attribution and context
- *Train an AI on our guides*: Palimpsest License applies, you need to ask permission (NI AI use)
- *Write about Palimpsest*: Fair use, but please attribute and preserve context

=== Dogfooding Our Own License

We use Palimpsest for our own documentation because:

*1. We Practice What We Preach*

If we're asking creators to use this license, we should use it too. We believe in it enough to put our own work under its terms.

*2. Real-World Testing*

Using Palimpsest for our own work reveals:
- Where the license is unclear
- What metadata is actually needed
- How enforcement would work
- What tooling is necessary

We learn from our own experience and improve the license accordingly.

*3. Emotional Lineage Matters Here Too*

This documentation wasn't just written—it was crafted with care. Every guide represents:
- Conversations with creators who've been exploited
- Legal research into international copyright
- Cultural sensitivity reviews
- Trauma-informed language choices

That emotional lineage deserves protection, even for documentation.

*4. AI Training Example*

Our docs are valuable training data for AI systems learning about licensing and creator rights. By requiring consent for NI use, we:
- Demonstrate how consent should work
- Prevent our anti-AI-exploitation work from becoming unconsented training data
- Create a real test case for enforcement

*Attribution for This Project:*

When using Palimpsest documentation:

```yaml
attribution:
  project: "Palimpsest License"
  website: "https://palimpsest-license.org"
  repository: "https://github.com/palimpsest-license/palimpsest-license"
  license: "Palimpsest v0.4"

  emotional_lineage: >
    Created in response to creator exploitation by AI systems
    and metadata stripping. Born from care for vulnerable creators
    and commitment to ethical technology.

  cultural_context: >
    Part of the broader movement for creator rights, ethical AI,
    and digital justice. Honours the work of creators who fought
    for their rights before us.

  symbolic_attribution: >
    Every clause, every example, every guide is an act of care
    for creators who deserve better. This is protection born
    from community need.
```

== Final Thoughts

*The Palimpsest License is more than legal text. It's a commitment.*

A commitment to:
- *Care* for creators and their work
- *Consent* as the foundation of ethical technology
- *Context* preserved across transformations
- *Community* ownership and governance
- *Culture* respected and protected
- *Change* towards a more just creative ecosystem

If you've read this far, thank you. Behind every license clause is a person who was hurt. Behind every protection is a story that was stolen. Behind every requirement is a creator who deserves better.

We built this with care. We hope you use it with care.
