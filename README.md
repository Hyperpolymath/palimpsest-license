## 🪶 What is the Palimpsest License?

The Palimpsest License is a symbolic, layered licensing framework designed for:

- Storytellers remixing trauma, myth, or displacement  
- Coders embedding emotion in synthetic environments  
- Journalists stitching composite truths  
- Designers shaping identity through atmospheric interfaces

It protects not just your creative work—but the emotional, cultural, and thematic integrity within it.

**Remixing is welcomed. Exploitation is not.**
