# Palimpsest License v0.4

**A judicially robust, dual-license framework for ethical AI training and cultural preservation.**

This repository contains the official text, guides, and tools for the Palimpsest License, a legal framework designed to protect the symbolic, emotional, and cultural integrity of creative works used in AI systems.

- **Dual Licensing**: Combines **Palimpsest v0.4** (for symbolic assets) and **AGPL v3.0** (for software) to provide comprehensive protection.
- **Watertight Jurisdiction**: Governed by **Dutch substantive law** and enforced in **Scottish courts**, chosen for their leadership in digital rights and human rights jurisprudence.
- **Robust Compliance Tools**: Includes a Julia-based license parser, audit templates, and clear developer guides to ensure ethical implementation.
- **Future-Proof**: Explicit clauses for Quantum AI (QAI), Neural Interface (NI) systems, and DAO governance.
