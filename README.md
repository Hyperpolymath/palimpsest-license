## 🪶 What is the Palimpsest License?

The Palimpsest License is a symbolic, layered licensing framework built for:

- Storytellers who remix trauma, myth, or displacement
- Coders who embed emotion in synthetic environments
- Journalists stitching composite truths
- Designers shaping identity through atmospheric interfaces

It protects not just your creative work—but the emotional, cultural, and thematic integrity within it. Remixing is welcomed. Exploitation is not.
