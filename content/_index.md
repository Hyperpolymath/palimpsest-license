Welcome to the Palimpsest License - a framework for ethical content use in an era of artificial intelligence and automated systems.

Named after manuscripts written over erased earlier text—where traces of the original remain visible—this license ensures that creators maintain attribution and ethical use rights even as their work is transformed, remixed, or used in AI training.
