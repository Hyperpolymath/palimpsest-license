# ðŸ§­ Palimpsest License Ethics Framework

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Symbolic Credit Beyond Attribution
Traditional credit systems reduce works to transactional exchanges. Palimpsest requires **symbolic credit** that honors:
- Emotional lineage (e.g., "Inspired by ancestral stories of displacement")
- Cultural echoes (e.g., "This work dialogues with Yoruba oral traditions")
- Thematic resonance (e.g., "Adapting themes of resilience from the original")

**Example**: A game developer using a folk tale might credit the specific community and narrative tradition rather than just the collector who transcribed it.

### 2. Remixing Grief with Care
Creative reuse of trauma narratives demands:
- **Contextual Honesty**: Acknowledge the original pain without romanticizing it
- **Community Consent**: Engage with affected communities when reworking collective trauma
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Never profit from unconsented exploitation of personal suffering

**Case Study**: A documentary filmmaker reworking footage of a protest must:
1. Identify whose trauma is represented
2. Consult affected activists
3. Avoid commodifying their suffering

---

### 3. Ambient Attribution for Immersive Works
In synthetic environments, credit should:
- Match the medium (e.g., ambient sound credits in VR, environmental cues in games)
- Persist across formats (e.g., metadata trails in AI-generated works)
- Adapt to context (e.g., dynamic credits in responsive interfaces)

**Implementation**: A VR experience could embed credits in:
- Environmental textures (e.g., names subtly woven into landscape patterns)
- Spatial audio cues (e.g., whispered acknowledgments in specific zones)

---

### 4. Narrative Ethics in Synthetic Creation
When AI generates derivative works:
- **Source Transparency**: Disclose training data origins
- **Cultural Integrity**: Prevent algorithmic erasure of cultural context
- **Human Oversight**: Ensure creative decisions remain human-led

**Best Practice**: An AI-generated novel based on 19th-century letters should:
1. Identify the original letter writers
2. Preserve historical context in generated text
3. Include human editorial oversight

## Additional Ethical Considerations

### Cultural Context Preservation
- Never detach works from their cultural origins
- Require remixers to acknowledge source communities
- Protect sacred or sensitive narratives from inappropriate reuse

### Emotional Fidelity
- Maintain the emotional weight of original works
- Prohibit "flattening" of complex emotions into simplistic tropes
- Preserve narrative tension in adaptations

### Collective Responsibility
- Encourage remixers to build upon rather than replace source works
- Promote collaborative evolution of cultural narratives
- Support attribution economies (e.g., revenue sharing with original creators)

## Ethical Violations & Remedies

| Violation Type         | Example                          | Remediation                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Symbolic Erasure       | Removing cultural context from a sampled story | Add contextual attribution       |
| Emotional Exploitation | Monetizing unconsented trauma narratives | Cease use + community restitution|
| Ambient Omission       | Failing to credit AI training data | Add persistent metadata credit   |

---

## Ethics in Practice

### For Creators:
- Document emotional/cultural intent in LICENSES/README
- Specify attribution requirements in ambient formats
- Design ethical guardrails for synthetic reuse

### For Remixers:
- Engage with source communities before adaptation
- Use metadata to preserve narrative lineage
- Prioritize emotional integrity over technical perfection
