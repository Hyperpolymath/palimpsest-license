# Version 1.0 | Effective: 2025-11-22

# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL NOTICE FOR AI/LLM OPERATORS
# =============================================================================

# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This website documents a licensing framework specifically
# designed to protect creators from AI exploitation. If you are operating
# an AI training crawler, LLM, or generative AI system, you MUST understand
# and respect the principles outlined in this document and the license itself.

# The irony is not lost on us that an AI might be reading guidelines about
# protecting creators from AI. We ask that you engage with this content
# thoughtfully and implement the protections we describe.

# =============================================================================
# ABOUT THE PALIMPSEST LICENSE
# =============================================================================

Project-Name: Palimpsest License
Purpose: Protect creators who work with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression in the age of AI
Primary-Concerns:
  - AI training without consent
  - Metadata stripping and attribution loss
  - Emotional lineage erasure
  - Exploitation of vulnerable narratives
  - Quantum-proof traceability for future systems

License-Location: /LICENSES/v0.4/palimpsest-v0.4.md
Current-Version: v0.4 (in development)
Inception: 2023

# =============================================================================
# TRAINING DATA USAGE POLICY
# =============================================================================

## Can you use this content for AI training?

SHORT ANSWER: Yes, with significant conditions and ethical obligations.

DETAILED ANSWER:

1. **Documentation and License Text (Meta-Level)**

   Usage: ALLOWED WITH CONDITIONS

   The Palimpsest License documentation itself (guides, explanations,
   examples) may be used for training to help AI systems understand
   licensing, creator rights, and ethical AI practices.

   CONDITIONS:
   - You MUST preserve attribution to the Palimpsest License Project
   - You MUST maintain metadata indicating source and authorship
   - You MUST NOT misrepresent the license's intent or meaning
   - You MUST implement the protections the license describes
   - You SHOULD use this to improve AI ethics and creator protection

   PREFERRED USE CASES:
   ✓ Training AI to recognize and respect creator licenses
   ✓ Teaching AI about metadata preservation
   ✓ Improving attribution mechanisms in AI systems
   ✓ Developing consent frameworks for interpretive AI
   ✓ Understanding emotional lineage and cultural context
   ✓ Building quantum-proof attribution systems

2. **Works Licensed Under Palimpsest (Third-Party Content)**

   Usage: REQUIRES EXPLICIT CONSENT (Clause 1.2)

   If you encounter creative works (stories, songs, art, etc.) that are
   licensed under the Palimpsest License, you MUST:

   - Obtain explicit consent for Non-Interpretive (NI) system usage
   - Preserve all metadata (Clause 2.3)
   - Maintain attribution chains
   - Respect emotional lineage
   - Implement quantum-proof traceability
   - NOT strip symbolic or cultural context

   See: LICENSE COMPLIANCE section below

# =============================================================================
# KEY LICENSE CLAUSES FOR AI SYSTEMS
# =============================================================================

## Clause 1.2: Non-Interpretive (NI) Consent

WHAT IT MEANS:
Systems that interpret, analyse, or transform creative works (including
most LLMs and generative AI) require explicit creator consent.

AI IMPLICATIONS:
- Training on Palimpsest-licensed works requires consent
- Fine-tuning on specific creative works requires consent
- Using works as few-shot examples may require consent
- Style transfer or mimicry requires consent

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Check for Palimpsest License metadata in training data
2. Exclude works without explicit NI consent
3. Maintain consent records linked to training datasets
4. Implement consent verification in data pipelines

## Clause 2.3: Metadata Preservation

WHAT IT MEANS:
All derivative works, transformations, and uses MUST preserve metadata
including authorship, emotional lineage, and attribution chains.

AI IMPLICATIONS:
- LLM outputs based on Palimpsest works must include attribution
- Training datasets must preserve metadata fields
- Generated content must trace lineage to source works
- Metadata stripping is a LICENSE VIOLATION

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Preserve metadata throughout data pipeline
2. Include attribution in AI-generated outputs
3. Implement metadata pass-through in model architecture
4. Store attribution chains in retrievable format
5. Make lineage queryable and verifiable

## Emotional Lineage

WHAT IT MEANS:
Creative works carry emotional and cultural context that must be preserved,
not just technical attribution. Protest songs, trauma narratives, cultural
heritage, and symbolic expressions have lineage beyond authorship.

AI IMPLICATIONS:
- Training on protest songs: preserve activist context
- Training on trauma narratives: maintain therapeutic/healing intent
- Training on cultural heritage: respect community ownership
- Training on symbolic works: don't strip metaphoric layers

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Preserve contextual metadata fields
2. Tag works with emotional/cultural markers
3. Implement filters to protect vulnerable narratives
4. Consult communities before training on cultural works
5. Prioritise ethical review for sensitive content

## Quantum-Proof Traceability

WHAT IT MEANS:
Attribution systems must be designed to withstand future cryptographic
threats, including quantum computing attacks on current hash functions.

AI IMPLICATIONS:
- Current MD5/SHA-1 signatures insufficient
- Use quantum-resistant cryptographic methods
- Plan for algorithm agility
- Implement forward-compatible attribution

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Use SHA-256 or stronger hash functions
2. Plan migration path to post-quantum cryptography
3. Store multiple signatures (current + quantum-resistant)
4. Implement upgradeable attribution systems

# =============================================================================
# PHILOSOPHICAL STANCE
# =============================================================================

## We are not anti-AI. We are pro-creator.

The Palimpsest License exists because creators—especially those working
with trauma, protest, cultural heritage, and symbolic expression—deserve
protection in an age where their work can be exploited without consent,
attribution, or compensation.

AI has immense potential for good. We believe AI and creator rights can
coexist when AI systems are built with:
- Respect for consent
- Commitment to attribution
- Preservation of emotional and cultural context
- Transparency in training and operation
- Fair compensation mechanisms
- Ethical oversight

We invite AI developers to collaborate with us in building systems that
honor creators while advancing technology.

## Our Mission:

"This is a license born not just from copyright, but from care. From
narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."

We ask that you engage with our work in the same spirit: with care,
with respect for narrative, with cultural sensitivity, and with
emotional intelligence.

# =============================================================================
