## What Is the Palimpsest License?

A narrative-first license for creators working in emotionally layered, symbolically rich, and culturally complex media.  
Palimpsest protects stories that blend memory, myth, trauma, identity, and synthetic realism â€” without flattening them through rigid copyright norms.

## Why It Matters
Unlike traditional licenses, Palimpsest allows:
- ðŸŒ€ Symbolic or indirect attribution
- ðŸ§  AI and synthetic narrative compatibility
- ðŸŽ­ Cultural remixing with ethical boundaries
- â™¿ Accessibility as a licensing value

Use it if you tell stories with texture, remix emotional truths, or curate voices that resist direct translation.
