# How to Verify Official Palimpsest License Releases

1. Repository Verification:
   - Official repository: github.com/palimpsest-license/palimpsest-license
   - Check for GitHub organisation verification badge
   - Verify repository is listed on palimpsest-license.org

2. Release Verification:
   - All official releases are tagged in Git
   - Tags are cryptographically signed
   - Verify signature: git tag -v v0.4.0
   - Check CHANGELOG.md for version history

3. Document Verification:
   - License texts include metadata headers
   - Check SHA-256 checksums (provided in releases)
   - Verify JSON-LD metadata blocks
   - Cross-reference version numbers across documents

4. Website Verification:
   - Official domain: palimpsest-license.org
   - HTTPS required (valid TLS certificate)
   - Content matches GitHub repository
   - Look for trust indicators (security.txt, etc.)

# =============================================================================

To verify you are using an authentic Palimpsest License:

☑ Check the source is github.com/palimpsest-license/palimpsest-license
☑ Verify the license file includes proper metadata headers
☑ Confirm the version number matches official releases
☑ Check the SHA-256 checksum against published hashes
☑ Verify GPG signature on signed releases
☑ Cross-reference with documentation on palimpsest-license.org
☑ Look for the official Palimpsest badge (see /assets/)
☑ Verify no modifications have been made (unless disclosed)

# Red Flags (Potential Forgery):
✗ Source is not the official GitHub repository
✗ License text lacks metadata headers
✗ Version numbers don't match official releases
✗ Checksums don't match
✗ GPG signatures fail verification
✗ Modifications without disclosure
✗ Contact information differs from official channels
✗ Domain is not palimpsest-license.org
